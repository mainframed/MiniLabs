- Type ‘I’ hit enter

- Type =3.2 in command line and hit enter
- In option line type A hit tab until cursor is at line "Name:"
- Type (with single quotes) '<userid>.LABS' hit enter

- In 'Dsname Level' type 'EVIL.**' hit enter
- Move cursor to command column in front of EVIL.LABS
- Type 'V' (for 'view') hit enter
- next to JCL type 'V' hit enter
- In the command line type 'cut' hit enter
- In the command line type '=3.4' hit enter
- In 'Dsname Level' type '<userid>.**' hit enter
- Tab to <userid>.LABS in the command column put 'e'
- In the command line type 's LAB01' and hit enter
- In the commad line type 'paste' and place cursor on first/top red asterix type 'A' (for after) hit enter

Part 4 - Editing

- In command column next to '<userid>.LABS' type 'E' and hit enter
- Next to 'LAB01' type 'e' and hit enter
- Replace all instances of '<user>' to your assigned userid (including <>). Note: UPPERCASE ONLY! 
- NOTE: The 'JOB' is placement specific, must be 10 chars from //. I.E. if your userid was EVIL3 you had to delete a '>' which moved the 'JOB' decleration and your job with fail, if thats the case, replace '>' with '0' so it would be //EVIL3001
- in the command line type 'save' and hit enter
- in the command line type 'submit' and hit enter

Part 5 - Getting the job output:

- Navigate to SDSF (either go to main ISPF menu by hitting F3 four times or by typing '=sd' in the command line and hitting enter
- on command line type 'OWNER <userid>'
- Type ‘ST’ and hit enter
- Beside the job you submitted (in column 'NP') type ‘?’ and hit enter
- Beside SYSTSPRT type ‘s’ and hit enter

BONUS BONUS BONUS

Get 'PATH' datasets:

- Anywhere in ISPF/SDSF: in command bar type ‘TSO ISRDDN’
OR
- Go to command enter screen (=6) and type ISRDDN

- Hit F8 until you find SYSEXEC or in the command line type ‘F SYSEXEC’ and hit enter

- This does the same thing: =6;ISRDDN;F SYSEXEC
- So does: DDLIST;F SYSEXEC
